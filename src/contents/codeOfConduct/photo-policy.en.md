# PHOTO POLICY

Photographs and videos taken during the conference will be released through JSConf Korea's official channels.

Whether you agree to be photographed will be indicated through your lanyard.

- Black: "It's okay to photograph/film me."

- Yellow: "Please do not photograph/film me."

All participants, including attendees, sponsor representatives, and staff members, shall do their best to respect the lanyards. If you must take a photo of someone wearing a yellow lanyard, please ask first. If someone in a yellow lanyard is in a photo you've taken, please blur them out or delete the photo.

Our photographers and videographers will take extra caution to respect the lanyards. However, in crowded situations, they may not be able to follow completely. If a photograph or a recording includes participants wearing yellow lanyards, we will blur them out or not publish it. Furthermore, once the photographs and videos are published, you can ask us to take down certain photographs that you do not want to be shared.

Note that for our group photo, the lanyards will be ignored, so if you do not want to be photographed here we ask you to step outside of the crowd.
